Caleb is a hard-working, dedicated technical writer who continuously strives to improve and grow. In the 3 ½ years I’ve worked with them, I’ve witnessed tremendous growth—not only in their writing ability but also in the key skills that make them an exceptional professional. Caleb has taken ownership of projects, collaborated seamlessly with engineering teams, strengthened their project management abilities, and even developed confidence in public speaking.

Caleb brings a unique blend of attention to detail, curiosity, and adaptability. What truly sets Caleb apart, however, is their collaborative nature and eagerness to take on new challenges. They approach every project with a positive attitude, communicate effectively across teams, and consistently go the extra mile to ensure clarity and quality in documentation. I regularly receive compliments on how easy and enjoyable Caleb is to work with—whether from engineers, project managers, or stakeholders. Their ability to listen, adapt, and respond to feedback makes them an invaluable team member, and I have no doubt they will continue to thrive in any role they take on.

:::info[They Said...]

I had the pleasure of hiring Caleb as a contract Technical Writer at Unity during the early days of Unity Learn. At the time, my team was focused on making Learn a premier learning platform, which meant we needed to rapidly expand our tutorial library. Caleb played a crucial role in helping us achieve that goal.

Their unique combination of skills—as a technical writer, Unity developer, and programmer—made them an invaluable asset. They were able to create high-quality learning content across a wide range of topics, helping us build a strong foundation for Learn’s successful launch. Beyond their expertise, Caleb is easygoing, adaptable, and always focused on delivering great content. They iterate quickly as needs evolve, making them a fantastic collaborator in a fast-moving environment.

I highly recommend Caleb to anyone looking for a skilled and versatile technical writer who understands both the technical and educational sides of content creation. They would be a tremendous addition to any team!
