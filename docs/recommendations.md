Caleb is a hard-working, dedicated technical writer who continuously strives to improve and grow. In the 3 ½ years I’ve worked with them, I’ve witnessed tremendous growth—not only in their writing ability but also in the key skills that make them an exceptional professional. Caleb has taken ownership of projects, collaborated seamlessly with engineering teams, strengthened their project management abilities, and even developed confidence in public speaking.

Caleb brings a unique blend of attention to detail, curiosity, and adaptability. What truly sets Caleb apart, however, is their collaborative nature and eagerness to take on new challenges. They approach every project with a positive attitude, communicate effectively across teams, and consistently go the extra mile to ensure clarity and quality in documentation. I regularly receive compliments on how easy and enjoyable Caleb is to work with—whether from engineers, project managers, or stakeholders. Their ability to listen, adapt, and respond to feedback makes them an invaluable team member, and I have no doubt they will continue to thrive in any role they take on.
