# Unity Technologies

:::tip[Skills used...]

Unity 3D, C#, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere, OBS

:::

## Summary

At Unity, I played a key role in developing comprehensive documentation and learning materials for the [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/) platform, helping developers effectively use the Unity engine. I authored 231 guides covering both emerging and existing Unity3D features, created 32 video tutorials for certification courses, and contributed to maintaining and updating existing documentation.

Leveraging my experience as a Unity 3D developer, programmer, and technical writer, I became a critical asset to the team, ensuring that instructional content was both technically accurate and easy to understand. In addition to authoring and managing documentation, I helped streamline documentation workflows, designing a new template that reduced review loops and writing C# gameplay scripts to supplement step-by-step guides.

Working closely with engineers, designers, and educators, I ensured that Unityâ€™s documentation was clear, accessible, and developer-friendly.
