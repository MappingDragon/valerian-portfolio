# Microsoft

While at Microsoft, I worked on supporting documentation efforts on a small team that wrote for a customer supporting tool called RAVE. I worked primarily to not only write documentation that walked new and existing users through the RAVE tool, but to also streamline several processes to help with documentation reporting, logging, and user engagement.

During my work, I noticed an exhaustive effort to put together monthly reports upon the documentation efforts using Amplify Reporting software. I took initiative and created a reporting tool that would leverage and generate the Amplify Report with a simple click of a button. This tool retrieved all relevant information, by parsing through the wiki by set dates or length of time. This tool also created archival reports to reference to create a viable history.
